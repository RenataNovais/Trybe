        <p class="bodyText">It's Quarentine Time, and it is not easy. But, that's okay. I'am not productive as I would like, but I keep trying to be my best and to study hard. I choose to start Trybe course during this quarentine time, and it has been a really good distraction to my mind. I believe that is important to keep our mind working in order to keep the balance of our system.</p>
